# URLYZER
> URLYZER is a project that was made during the information systems bachelor course, at Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, as a final paper by me and my mentor orientation. The purpose of this project was to built a website that given an URL as an input, its lexical characteristics are extracted and then the website returns how the URL was classified: benign or malicious.
