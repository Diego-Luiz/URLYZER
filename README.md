# URLYZER
URLYZER is a website that classifies an URL as benign or malicious, according to the _Random Forest_ classificator and the URL lexical features extracted. This project was presented as a final paper in Bachelor's degree in Information Systems, at Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil üáßüá∑, 2021.
## Website Folder üìÅ
> This folder contains all the files about the website.
### > How to run the project
> Make sure to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed in your computer (in this project the version used was 3.9.5). After that follow the steps below:

**1.** Create a folder to this project and put the **_urlyzer_** folder inside it.

2. Install the _python virtual environment_ in your computer and create one, after that you can active the virtual environment. You can see more about it [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

**3.** With the virtual environment **activated** and in the right path of the **_urlyzer_** folder, install all the requirements used in this project. </h4>
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**4.** Modify the _settings.py_ inside _urlyzer_ folder putting the host(s) you want to run the server.
In the line **28** (you can edit this parameter putting the allowed host(s) to run the project):
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS=['127.0.0.1']
```

**5.** Now you can run the django server with the command:
```
python manage.py runserver --insecure
```
The parameter ```--insecure``` is needed because of the parameter ```DEBUG``` setted as```False```.

### > How URLYZER works
According to the URL string put in the _home page_ the site analyzes it and classifies as benign or malicious, putting a web page according to the classification. In the respective page you can come back to the start or go ahead and access the website related to the input URL.

#### Observation ‚ö†Ô∏è
If your choice was to access the website represented by the URL, URLYZER will try to access a website with that **exactly URL string given**. Then make sure it's in the right form.

## AI Folder üñø
> In this folder are the files about the _python_ modules used to build the classificator model, some datasets, the main _jupyter notebook_ about the training, test and results process and the final classificator model used in the project.
